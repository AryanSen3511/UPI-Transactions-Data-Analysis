## 📌 Project Overview

This is an end-to-end Data Analytics project based on **UPI Transaction Data**, where I performed data loading, profiling, cleaning, data modeling, creating visuals, and designing an interactive dashboard using **Power BI**.

The dashboard provides insights into **UPI transaction trends, revenue performance, user demographics, and payment behavior patterns**.
